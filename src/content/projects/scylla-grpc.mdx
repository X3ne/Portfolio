The reason I was interested in go was also to explore the world of gRPC with protobuf.
[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) also interested me because of its impressive scalability. ScyllaDB is the C++ version of Cassandra
[Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) (Java),
which makes it possible to do away with jvm and garbage collection. Why not bring these two subjects together and launch a project?
It's a fairly straightforward project involving ScyllaDB setup with docker, very simple authentication with jwt and routes to retrieve users.

# Why gRPC

[gRPC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC) is an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework based on
[HTTP/2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol/2). It uses Protocol Buffers as IDL (Interface Description Language)
instead of json, which brings significant advantages: it's language agnostic (we can implement our logic in several languages thanks to gRPC's code generation),
protobuf serializes our data in binary, which drastically improves serialization/deserialization and optimizes communication between client and server.

<br />

gRPC also provides a variety of communication options,

<br />

#### Unary RPC:
Like REST, the client sends a single request and receives a single response from the server.

<br />

#### Server streaming RPC:
Like unary RPC, the client sends a single request, but the server responds with a stream of messages.

<br />

#### Client streaming RPC:
This is the opposite of server-streaming RPC: the client sends a stream of messages to the server,
and the server responds with a single message after receiving all the client's messages.

<br />

#### Bidirectional streaming RPC
Here the call is initiated by the client and the server can either respond or wait for the client to start streaming messages.
The client and server can read and write messages in any order, with the server either waiting for the client to send all its messages before replying with server messages,
or the client and server can play "ping-pong", with the client sending a message and the server replying, and so on.

<br />
<br />

gRPC itself offers interesting features, such as the  [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) provided by HTTP/2,
[Deadlines/Timeouts](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#deadlines),
[RPC termination](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#rpc-termination) and the
[ability to stop](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#cancelling-an-rpc) a request at any time.

<br />

Instead of google's simple gRPC framework, I use [connect](https://connectrpc.com/) developped by buf. It's a collection of libraries around gRPC that provides libraries for browsers, nodejs, go...

# ScyllaDB workers

ScyllaDB is a NoSQL database, it's a key-value store. It's a distributed database, which means that it can be scaled horizontally by adding nodes.
But in ScyllaDB when a large number of requests are made on a node, "hot partitions" appear. This is simply a hardware limitation,
which may be due to the CPU or IOs simply being overloaded.

<br />

### POC

To remedy this problem (which isn't a problem at my scale), I've gone for a workers system.
When the api get a request and needs to access the database a new worker is created with the query stored.
If the service already has an worker with this query the request is subscribed to that worker and when the
database query is completed the response is sent to all subscribers.

This is useful when the server receives concurrent requests with the same database query, allowing a single query to be executed on the database.

# Conclusion

gRPC is a powerfull framework, it's a good alternative to REST. I like protobuf to write my methods and messages, it's simple and fast to integrate in a project.
With the server reflection we can easily create a client to test our api in various tools like postman or gRPCui.
gRPC shines in the world of microservices, which is definitely an area I'd like to explore.
