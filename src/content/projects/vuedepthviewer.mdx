import DepthViewer from '../../components/DepthViewer.vue'

<DepthViewer client:load />

<br />

I loved doing this project, it allowed me to learn about CI/CD, WebGL,
the world of depthmaps and how to bundle an npm module. To use this package you just have
to install it in your vue or nuxt projects with `pnpm install vue-depth-viewer`.
I've tried to create a package that's easy to use, but unfortunately the results can't be 100% satisfactory,
depending on the depthmap used.
For the example above, I used [ZoeDepth](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shariqfarooq/ZoeDepth)
and inverted the depthmap colors (white means greater distance).

<br />

To import the viewer into your app, just import the component and the css and add it to your template.

```vue
<script setup>
import VueDepthViewer from "vue-depth-viewer"
import "vue-depth-viewer/style.css"
</script>

<template>
<VueDepthViewer
  :img="image"
  :depth-img="depth"
  :options="{
    horizontalThreshold: 30,
    verticalThreshold: 150,
  }"
/>
</template>
```

I've added options to make the component more modular:

```ts
export interface DepthViewerOptions {
  horizontalThreshold?: number
  verticalThreshold?: number
  crop?: boolean
  useMouse?: boolean
  useScreen?: boolean
}
```

`horizontalThreshold` and `verticalThreshold` are the values that define the strength of the parallax effect.

`crop` is a useful boolean if you want to put the viewer in a container,
the image will crop to take up all the space in the container (similar to `background-size: cover;` in css)

`useMouse` is a boolean that allows you to enable or disable the mouse parallax effect.

`useScreen` is a boolean that allows you to use the mouse parallax effect outside the container.

<br />

I like the results when the depthmap is of good quality.
I know there are still a few details and issues to fix out,
but on the whole it works well.
